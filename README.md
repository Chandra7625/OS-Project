# OS-Project

Introduction
MEDFS is a project designed to demonstrate key operating system concepts such as multithreading, synchronization, and file system design. The system combines a FUSE-based file system with a multithreaded server that handles encrypted client requests over SSL/TLS. The goal is to create a secure, concurrent, and distributed file handling system.
